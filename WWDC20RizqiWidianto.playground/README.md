# WWDC2020 Student Swift Challenge Submission - Fun Circuit Simulator

Demo: https://youtu.be/_PXUouyIP3s


Fun Circuit Simulator is a simulator that can help teacher to teach about electronical component with fun method and gamification while doing School From Home during pandemic. I am currently an undergraduate physics student and I created this apps because my professor's complains. He said that he couldn't  teach any practical modules during pandemic, meanwhile the softwares to do circuit simulation like Multisim is lack of fun and also quite expensive for students to buy. So i created this apps to solve those problems.

Source Code:
- I used and modificate collection view and gesture part of WWDC 2019 Scholarship winner code, Maulana Rizal Hilman. (https://github.com/drawrs/WWDC19-Submission-SandCastle-Game). I use this open source code because it can pan object from collection view smoothly.

Sounds :
- Backsound : Autopilot by SI-PML (https://www.freesfx.co.uk/Category/Electronica/208). I use this music because my app theme is electronical component and the theme of this backsound is also electronica. 
- Tap Sound: I use Applause sound effect from https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-sounds/applause-10033/ whenever the button is tapped
- Fail Sound:  Electric Current from https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-sounds/electric-sounds-10032/ this sound is played when user tap the play button while the requirement is not completed yet.
